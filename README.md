LoLDraftSimulator is my attempt to build an Esports Fantasy League game using players from League of Legends. The objective is to collect cards based on real esports players and compete against others in Pick-Ban matches similar to the professional scene. Odds favor card compositions that best align with the player's individual performances and synergies with their favorite champions, teammates, etc. 

I started this project in November 2024 in an effort to showcase my abilities as a software engineer/game developer and the lessons I learn as I go. Currently, I am in the middle of fixing my data scraper tools to build a strong dataset for cards. 

You can find my most updated roadmap [here](https://www.notion.so/LoLDraftSimulator-Roadmap-1de9f96c2cf7806e8635f00224dfcae4?pvs=4). 

Thank you for coming and I hope to see you again soon with more updates!
