# 🃏 LoLDraftSimulator

**LoLDraftSimulator** is the unofficial name for this project to create an Esports Fantasy League game featuring real League of Legends pro players.

The core gameplay lets you **collect cards** based on actual esports players and compete against others in **Pick-Ban matches** that mirror the professional scene. Odds and strategies are influenced by player performance, champion pools, past teammates, and more—creating a dynamic and stats-driven fantasy experience.

## 🚀 Project Motivation

Started in **November 2024** as a way to:
- Showcase my skills as a **software engineer** and **game developer**
- Learn and document new lessons along the way

I’m currently focused on improving my data scraper tools to build a robust dataset for player cards.
